# The Process
### Component 1: Project Setup and Responsive Navigation
In this component, I've set up the development environment and create a responsive navigation bar for the landing page. The learning points includeed mastering mobile-first design principles and implementing a toggle for the navigation menu on small screens using JavaScript.

### Component 2: Hero and Endorsements
In this component, I developed the hero section of the landing page, which is the first element that captures a visitor's attention. and  also incorporated client endorsements to build trust and credibility. The learning points included utilizing Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing hero section and understanding layout techniques that make the landing page content stand out.

### Component 3: Features
In this component, I detail the services and features of Cache Bank, ensuring that each aspect is visually attractive and clearly explained. The learning points included applying grid and Flexbox layouts for a consistent design and using Tailwind classes to maintain a cohesive look and feel.

### Component 4: Stats and Getting Started
In this component, I've construct a section that showcases Cache Bank's impact through statistics and includes a 'Getting Started' call-to-action. The learning points include learning CSS layout techniques for presenting data and understanding how to design compelling call-to-action sections.

### Component 5: Contact and Footer
In this component, I've finish the project with a contact section and a comprehensive footer. The focus was on designing a contact section and footer that build trust and ensure compliance. The learning points included setting up effective and user-friendly contact details and including essential elements in the footer like privacy policy, terms of use, and social media links.

## Areas of Mastery
CSS Layout Techniques: I feel confident in using Flexbox and Grid to structure web page elements. Implementing these techniques to align and distribute content was a highlight of my learning.
Responsive Design: I successfully used tailwind CSS to ensure the page looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.
Styling Elements: I was able to style the Cache Bank Landing Page Portfolio Piece.

## Challenges Faced
The Responsiveness of the Navigation Bar, Like the most challenge was div tags, because the component 1 videos was very confusing at first when they nested divs inside another div. So that one thing was a challenge, but going through the video second time it became clear how to do them. Then at the end i managed to do it correctly. The other challenge was the first div as it didn't include the footer to be nested inside it, and the footer is outside the main div that consists of Navigation Bar, Hero-Endorsement, Features, Stats-Getting Started Section only. 

## üìö What I Learned
